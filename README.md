## I make each and every project that I participate in an integral part of my life in order to successfully complete it. Assiduity in learning and evolving, to give a better destiny to everyone who supports me, thus forming a network of peace and prosperity around me, respect and trust are the basis of prosperity.

I'm interested in being a Web and Mobile, Full-Stack developer in web 3.0. I'm currently learning NODE, REACT, JAVASCRIPT(and frameworks), Python at KENZIE ACADEMY BRAZIL.
In addition to Kenzie, I study entrepreneurship and management at Universidade Federal Fluminense.
